Description: This package provides various themes, palettes, and other functions
    that are used to customise ggplots to look like they were made in GraphPad 
    Prism. The 'Prism-look' is achieved by \code{theme_prism()} and 
    \code{scale_fill|colour_prism()} which include all of the Prism colour 
    schemes as palettes. Several axis guides are included which mirror those
    available in the 'Frame and Origin' tab of Prism. P-values and significance
    brackets can be added to plots using \code{add_pvalue()}.
